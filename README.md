# Logistic-regression-is-regression
Despite the popular yet wrong claim that logistic regression "is not a regression", it's one of the key regression and hypothesis testing tools in epxerimental research (like clinical trials). I will share information from my field to break the bizzare situation, when people from Machine Learning tell me that "what we do every day cannot be done".

I will populate the repository over time with information. 

We will talk about the history, the GLM framework and conditional distributions

applications of the logistic regression in experimental research

talk about using it for testing hypotheses

and show how weird is to claim what many Machine Learning practitioners and gurus repeat in their courses, books and blogs, denying a BIG piece of research in many fields of science and the basic statistical definitions...

We wil also propose some valuable books for researchers (not focused on classification)
